      <p>
        Welcome to our community! I'm Raymond, the creator of this site. During
        the COVID-19 pandemic, I found myself reflecting on the lack of
        representation for Asian Americans in mainstream media. This led me to
        create a platform dedicated to highlighting the stories and achievements
        of influential Asian Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is simple: to provide a safe space where Asian Americans can
        discover role models who look like them and celebrate their
        accomplishments. From trailblazers to emerging talents, we aim to
        showcase the diversity and richness of our community.
      </p>
      <p>
        We strive to shed light on the contributions of Asian Americans across
        various fields. From entertainment to entrepreneurship, our goal is to
        inspire the next generation of leaders and change-makers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join us in celebrating the voices and talents of Asian Americans.
        Together, let's build a more inclusive and representative media
        landscape.
