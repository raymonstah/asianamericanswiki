## Gemini Added Memories
- The project uses HTMX for dynamic UI updates and Go templates for server-side rendering. Generated images are stored locally in 'tmp/xai_generations/' for review before being uploaded to GCS.
- Always run `golangci-lint run` (or the project's equivalent lint command) and fix any reported issues before finalizing changes.
