Tricia Wang is a tech ethnographer who uses data to study their impact on local
communities. She has given a
[TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/tricia_wang_the_human_insights_missing_from_big_data)
on why we should focus instead on "thick data" instead of big data, and how we
can combine the two to make better business decisions.

More recently, Tricia founded CRADL, "Crypto Research and Design Lab", whose
mission is to put people at the center of crypto.
