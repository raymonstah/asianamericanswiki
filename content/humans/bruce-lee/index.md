Bruce Lee was a Chinese Martial Artist who was born in San Francisco, but
returned to Hong Kong as a baby to live out his childhood years. In 1959, Bruce
Lee returned to the states due to his juvenile troubles in Hong Kong. After
studying philosophy and drama in college, he moved to Oakland to continue his
Martial Arts practice professionally. Shortly after, he entered Hollywood and
introduced Kung Fu to the rest of the world.

Bruce Lee is regarded as one of the most important Asian Americans in history,
not only for his elite skills in Martial Arts, but also because he paved the way
for the future generations of Asian Americans in Hollywood, showing the world
that Asians can play the main role of a film.
