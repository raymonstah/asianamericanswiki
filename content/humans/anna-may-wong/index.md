Anna May Wong (January 3, 1905 â€“ February 3, 1961) was an American actress,
considered to be the first Chinese American movie star and the first Asian
American actress to gain widespread recognition. Born and raised in Los Angeles,
she began appearing in silent films at the age of 17, quickly becoming a leading
lady in Hollywood.

Over the course of her four-decade career, she starred in over sixty films,
mostly in supporting roles. Notable works include Toll of the Sea (1922) and The
Thief of Bagdad (1924), in which she became the first Asian woman to act in a
Hollywood feature film. She also achieved success as a stage actress, appearing
in London and touring Europe in the 1920s, and making three trips to China and
one to India.

In addition to acting, Wong also had a successful career as an entrepreneur and
model. She was a fashion icon in the 1920s, as well as the first Chinese
American to publish a novel and the first to become a cosmetics spokesmodel.

Although she was a trailblazer in the film industry, Wong's career was hampered
by the racism of Hollywood and its refusal to cast her in lead roles related to
her Chinese heritage. Still, she is fondly remembered for her pioneering
accomplishments and is often cited as an early role model for other Asian
American actors. In 1998, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors declared
Anna May Wong Day in her honor. She is memorialized in the names of city parks
and buildings in Los Angeles, including the historic Anna May Wong Theater.

Anna May Wong is the first Asian American to appear on a US coin.
