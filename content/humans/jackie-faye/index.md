Jackie Faye is an Asian American, female, singer/rapper. Born and raised in
Dallas, this Taiwanese-Korean-Texan cultivated her love for music in the dirty
south - surrounded by the musical influences of Erykah Badu, Three 6 Mafia,
Outkast, and many more. As a data engineer by day, she manages to gain traction
through various performances for cultural organizations, dropping her latest
single, Grey Skies on all streaming platforms! In this unfiltered interview, we
talk about the importance of setting boundaries with others as an Asian American
woman in male-dominated industries, coming out to her mother, and being
unapologetically herself!
