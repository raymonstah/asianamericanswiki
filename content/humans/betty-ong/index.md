Betty Ann Ong was an American flight attendant aboard American Airlines Flight
11, the first airplane hijacked during the September 11 attacks. Ong was the
first person to alert authorities to the hijackings taking place that day.[1]
Shortly after the hijacking, Ong notified the American Airlines ground crew of
the hijacking, staying on the radiophone for 25 minutes to relay vital
information that led to the closing of airspace by the FAA, a first in United
States history. For this, the 9/11 Commission declared Ong a hero.
