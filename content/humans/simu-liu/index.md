Simu is most well known for playing the role of Shang-Chi, the first Marvel
Asian superhero. He also has prior roles on Kim's Convenience, Awkwafina Is Nora
From Queens, Fresh Off the Boat, Yappie, and many more.

Simu's Chinese name means introspection, or ideation, and envy, to serve as a
reminder of his parents' decision and sacrifices they've made to keep Simu
separated until he turned five. Simu also has a Chinese nickname, Maomao.

Simu was born in Harbin, China, and by his grandparents. When he turned five,
his father came to take him back to Toronto so that he could reunite with his
parents. Simu learned English using flash cards when he was still in Harbin, in
preparation of his journey to Canada.
