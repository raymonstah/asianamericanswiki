Joseph Kahn (born October 12, 1972) is a Korean-American music video director,
film director, screenwriter and producer. He is best known for directing the
Eminem music video "Without Me" (2002) and the feature films Torque (2004) and
Detention (2011). He has directed music videos for such artists as Mariah Carey,
Britney Spears, U2, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Taylor Swift, Muse, Lady Gaga,
Backstreet Boys, Shakira, Maroon 5 and others. He has won four MTV Video Music
Awards, a Grammy and seven VMAs, more than any other music video director in
history.

Early life and career

Kahn was born in Busan, South Korea and was adopted at the age of one. He was
raised in eastern Los Angeles, and graduated from East Los Angeles College,
where he studied photography. His first film was an eight-minute short video
titled The Throwaway, which won Best Drama at the Chicago International Film
Festival in 1994. In 1996, he directed five music videos for DreamWorks' first
artist, Hullaballoo, and it led to Kahn being hired as a music video director by
various record labels. In 2002, Kahn directed the video for Eminem's single
"Without Me", which became one of the biggest hits of the year, and won four MTV
Video Music Awards, a Grammy, and seven VMAs.

Directing works

In 2004, Kahn directed the action-thriller feature film Torque, starring Martin
Henderson, Ice Cube, and Monet Mazur, and produced by Lucas Foster. Torque went
on to be the second highest grossing film in the US for the month of January,
making over $50 million domestically. In 2007, he directed a fantasy-comedy
movie, Aliens in the Attic, for Fox. In 2011, Kahn released Detention, a teen
comedy starring Josh Hutcherson, Dane Cook, and Shakeelah Adam. The film, set in
a high school, centers around a group of students trying to survive their final
year, which has been thrown off-course by a slasher movie killer.
