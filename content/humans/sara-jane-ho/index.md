Sara Jane Ho (born 1978) is a Chinese American etiquette teacher, television
host, and businesswoman. She is the founder and CEO of Institute Sarita, the
first modern and lifestyle etiquette brand in China, and Ping language school, a
Beijing-based language school for adults.

## Early life

Ho was born in 1978 in Arcadia, California to Chinese parents and grew up in
Boston, Massachusetts. She attended Harvard University, where she majored in
sociology and gender studies, and graduated in 1999. Ho was raised with Chinese
cultural values, which included understanding the complexities of social
etiquette.

## Career

Shortly after graduating, Ho left her job in Boston and moved to Beijing to
pursue a career in the fashion industry. During her time living in China, she
recognized a void of style, etiquette, and decorum â€” topics that weren't
discussed or taught in local schools. With this inspiration, Ho founded
Institute Sarita in 2011, the first modern and lifestyle etiquette brand in
China. As the CEO of Institute Sarita, as well as Ping language school, Ho is
devoted to teaching etiquette, international relationships and personal style.

Ho has been featured in numerous television and print articles, including
appearances on Forbes, BBC, BBC London, China Global Television Network, and
China Central Television. She has also been a lifestyle columnist for the China
Daily and Harper's Bazaar magazine.

In 2021, Ho was named in Forbes Asia's Top 50 Women in China list.

In 2022, Ho released a Netflix series, "Mind Your Manners", where she helps
people become their best selves through good manners.

## Philanthropy

Ho is an active philanthropist and supports a number of charities, including
Teach For China, a nonprofit that supports Teach For All's mission to provide
all children with an excellent education. Ho contributes to other charities such
as Barefoot College, Opportunity China and Humanitas Global.

In 2016, Ho was recognized as a Changemaker by the United Nations Global Compact
and the China Women's Development Foundation in their Changemakers 2012 program.
