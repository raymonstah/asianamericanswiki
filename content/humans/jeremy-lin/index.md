Jeremy Lin is the first Chinese American NBA player. He grew up in the Bay Area
and attended Harvard University, eventually signing with the Golden State
Warriors in 2010. In 2011, he had his breakthrough season in the NBA with the
New York Knicks, dubbed "Linsanity". As of 2021, he plans on playing in the CBA
with the Beijing Ducks. During his time in America, Lin has put up with tons of
racism, from being mocked and called slurs both on and off the court. He is a
voice for the Asian American community and continues to inspire and be a role
model for the future generations of Asian Americans to come.
