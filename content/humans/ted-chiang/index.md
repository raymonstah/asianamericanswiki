Ted Chiang (born 1967) is an American science fiction and fantasy author widely
known for works such as "Story of Your Life," which was adapted into the
acclaimed film Arrival and "The Lifecycle of Software Objects." His writing has
been nominated for and won numerous awards, including the Nebula Award, the Hugo
Award and the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer.

Chiang was born in Port Jefferson, New York, and grew up in Flushing, Queens. He
attended Brown University, graduating with a degree in computing and information
science. Initially, he planned to become a software engineer, but instead chose
to pursue writing after being inspired by the science fiction works of authors
such as Philip K. Dick and Greg Bear.

Chiang's first published piece, "Tower of Babylon," appeared in 1990 in the
magazine Omni. It was subsequently reprinted in The Year's Best Science Fiction:
Seventh Annual Collection (ed. Gardner Dozois, 1991) and several
otheranthologies. His first collection, Stories of Your Life and Others, was
published in 2002. In addition to "Tower of Babylon," it includes stories such
as "Division By Zero" and "Hell Is the Absence of God" and has become a classic
of modern science fiction. He has since published two more collections,
Exhalation: Stories (2009) and The Lifecycle of Software Objects (2020).

Chiang's works often explore philosophical themes, including identity, religion,
technology and linguistic/cultural boundaries. He is noted for his meticulous
research process and attention to detail, as well as his unique storytelling
style.
