# Welcome

Welcome to the open source database of Asian Americans! This website aims to provide a list of influential Asian
Americans, dead or alive. We believe creating this list is important because representation matters. With your
contribution, we can grow the list of influential asian americans to help inspire the generations to come.

We built this for the Asian Americans like ourselves growing up without too many Asian role models. I felt something
like this was missing in our community. Growing up, I didn't see a lot of people that looked like myself on the big
screens. I didn't have a lot of role models who were Asian American. This is the place where I can not only learn about
the history of important Asian American figures, but also discover new creators, musicians, entrepreneurs,
professionals, and role models of the future generation. So this is for the current and next generations of Asian
Americans who are looking to be inspired by others. This is meant to fill the missing void of the missing role models,
to see what's been done before and to push the boundaries of what can be done.

The list of influential Asian Americans continues to grow every day, with more and more people excelling at what they
do. This website aims to solve that. I wanted to build something for the people, that would also allow contributions by
the people. There are over 20 million of us, and we're a whole lot stronger when we collaborate and work together.

# Technical details

This entire website is open sourced on [Github](https://github.com/raymonstah/asianamericanswiki). It's built using a
static site generator, so all the content is written in Markdown. If you're a developer and want to contribute to the
list, please open a pull request. In the meantime, we're working on a form that you can submit to simplify the process
for less technical users.
