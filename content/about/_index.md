# Welcome

Welcome to the open source database of Asian Americans! This is the place to not
only learn about the history of important Asian American figures, but also
discover new creators, musicians, entrepreneurs, professionals, and role models
of the future generation. This is for those who are looking to be inspired by
others. This is meant to fill the missing void of the absent role models in our
lives, to see what's been done before and to push the boundaries of what can be
done.

The number of influential Asian Americans continues to grow every day, with more
and more people excelling at what they do. Together, we can build something for
the people. There are over 20 million of us, and we're a lot stronger when we
collaborate and work together.
